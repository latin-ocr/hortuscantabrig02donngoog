in this particular, by adopting recent names wherever
any advantage seemed likely to acerne from doing so:
particularl among Grasses and Orchideous plauts,

· The ad itionS‚ which are considerable, have been
selected from such materials as are accessible3 and
have been made especially among such tribes of plants
as are favourites with cultivatorS, rather than among
those which are merely sub'ects os Botanical interest.
Thus, in the ScitamineouS,'l-iliaceou8‚ RosaceouS, and·
Orchideous tribes», much new matter will be discovered 3,
while, on the other hand, scarcely any addition has
been made to GrasseS‚ UmbelliferouS‚ and Cruciferous
plants. Such a measure has become absolutely neces-
sary3 sor importations to this country have now swelled-
the lists of plants in Botanical Gardens so much be-
yond their former limus, that a work twice the size ff·
and price of the present would be insufficient to con-¹ ⁷
tain the enumeration of· their names·
