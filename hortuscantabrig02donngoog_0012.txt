of *synonyms and quotations; but-‚it -was- considered
that, however valuable in 'the closet,-they could have
little advantageous bearing upon practice. Th'ere
could also have been no difficulty in adding to the
names of Genera those of the Natural Orders to which.
they are referred by Botanists: it has been-felt, how-
ever, that the problematical opinions of Botanists have
little interest or recommendation with those who‘are
unacquainted with the principles upon which their
theories are founded, and perhaps less connexion with

the operative employments of the garden; and that-if ·

indicating Natural Orders in their actual state of im-
perfectiori is practically useful to any extent, it cannot
be so‘by making them subordinate to an artificial mode
of arrangement3 but must depend for its applicability
to the purposes of cultivators‚ upon an arrangement of
which the method of N atural Orders must be the basis.
It has not been thought advisable to adopt all the al-
terations in nomenclature to which¹ th‘e progress of
Botanical science is continually giving rise3 but rather
to avoid as much as possible substituting names newly
given to plant8‚ for those by which they have hitherto
been distinguished. It is particularly requested‚ how-
ever, that it may be distinctly understood, that no opi-
nion whatever is offered upon the soundness of. the nu-
merous new genera which have not been adopted 3 but
that the popular nomenclature has been adhered to,
simply because it is popular, and because it is very

¹ doubtful whether the advantage of what may possibly

be a more perfect nomenclature‚ is not surpassed by the
disadvantage of perplexing the memory of indifferent
and uninformed persons with changeS, the propriety
of which is only felt in the closet of the Botanist. Ι
