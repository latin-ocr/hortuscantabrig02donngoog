THE FIFTH VOLUME

T lte Rev. Dr. Lingar‘g’s IIistory of England.

' This Volume ,will comprise the Reigns of the Sister Qneens, Mam· and Eun-
ηψπ. The reign of Mqu though short and in lorioussis mot devoid of interest,
and the restoration of the (3111110ϋό’11ὖοιῑε11ῐὶ1ζΙ t ie persecution of the Refonners,

The long reiffn of her successor, a reign which occupied nearly the half of a
century, will o er to his view a succession of still more interesting events. He
will observe the steps by which Elizabeth abolished the ancient, and introduced
the reformed‚ hierarchy and worship3 the severities with which she repressed the
discontent of the Catholics and the intemperance of the Puritans3 her ambiguous,
and often unjustitiable, conduct towards the unfortunate Mary Stuart5 her in-
uigues with the Scottis-h, F rench, and Flemish religionistsz and her wars, the
consequences of those intrigues‚ with their several sovereigns3 the extension of
the English commerce under her auspices3 the triumphs of the English misy over
the formidante fleets of Spain ; the successive rise and fall of her different favou-
ritem and the cara, the sorrowS, and the despondency of her declining age. It
is difficult ω imagine subjecta better calculated to interest the feelings of English.

ratives of preceding writers; has pei-used with attention the many collections of
state papers belonging to the period3 and has frequently consula-d the dgsgptchoe
of the F rench, the Spanish, and the Imperial ambassadors. He is satisiied wtth the
result of his researches z--they have enabled him ’ (so at least he flatters himself)

to elucidate much that has been thought obscure, aud ω discover much that has -

been hitherto unknown.
